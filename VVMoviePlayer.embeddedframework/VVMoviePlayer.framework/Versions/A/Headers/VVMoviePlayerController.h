 @discussion A VolarVideo movie player (of type VVMoviePlayerController) manages the playback of a movie from a file or a network stream. Playback occurs in a view owned by the VolarVideo movie player and takes place either fullscreen or inline. You can incorporate a movie player’s view into a view hierarchy owned by your app, or use an VVMoviePlayerViewController object to manage the presentation for you.
 
 VolarVideo movie players do not yet support wireless movie playback to AirPlay-enabled hardware such as Apple TV.
 
 When you add a movie player’s view to your app’s view hierarchy, be sure to size the frame correctly, as shown here:
 
 ```
     VVMoviePlayerController *player = [[VVMoviePlayerController alloc] initWithExtendedVMAPURIString:myURLString];
     [player.view setFrame: myView.bounds];  // player's frame must match parent's
     [myView addSubview: player.view];
     // ...
     [player play];
 ```
 
 Consider a VolarVideo movie player view to be an opaque structure. You can add your own custom subviews to layer content on top of the movie but you must never modify any of its existing subviews.
 
 In addition to layering content on top of a movie, you can provide custom background content by adding subviews to the view in the backgroundView property. Custom subviews are supported in both inline and fullscreen playback modes but you must adjust the positions of your views when entering or exiting fullscreen mode. Use the MPMoviePlayerWillEnterFullscreenNotification and MPMoviePlayerWillExitFullscreenNotification notifications to detect changes to and from fullscreen mode.
 
 This class supports programmatic control of movie playback, and user-based control via buttons supplied by the movie player. You can control most aspects of playback programmatically using the methods and properties of the MPMediaPlayback protocol, to which this class conforms. The methods and properties of that protocol let you start and stop playback, seek forward and backward through the movie’s content, and even change the playback rate. In addition, the controlStyle property of this class lets you display a set of standard system controls that allow the user to manipulate playback. You can also set the shouldAutoplay property for network-based content to start automatically.
 
 You typically specify the movie you want to play when you create a new VVMoviePlayerController object. However, you can also change the currently playing movie by changing the value in the contentURL property. Changing this property lets you reuse the same movie player controller object in multiple places. For performance reasons you may want to play movies as local files. Do this by first downloading them to a local directory.
 
 > **Note:** Although you can create multiple VVMoviePlayerController objects and present their views in your interface, only one movie player at a time can play its movie.
 
 To facilitate the creation of video bookmarks or chapter links for a long movie, the VVMoviePlayerController class defines methods for generating thumbnail images at specific times within a movie. You can request a single thumbnail image using the thumbnailImageAtTime:timeOption: method or request multiple thumbnail images using the requestThumbnailImagesAtTimes:timeOption: method.
 
 To play a network stream whose URL requires access credentials, first connect to your VolarVideo site account by creating a VVCMSAPI instance.  With the credential and protection space information in place, you can then play the protected stream.
